        <h1>Content Management Systems and Development Frameworks</h1>
        <h2>Content Management Systems</h2>
        <p>In the real world of Web development, development frameworks and content management systems are often used to create user interfaces and to manage site structure. These frameworks take care of several tedious issues like cross-browser support and navigation between pages within the site. Different systems come with different levels of accessibility support.</p>
        <p>Two of the most popular content management systems that support accessibility are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="http://drupal.org/">Drupal</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>These systems provide good semantic structure to pages, allow full access to the user interface through both mouse and keyboard actions, and prompt users to enter accessibility information like alternative text for images. Additionally, there are several extensions that can be added to the systems to increase the accessibility.</p>
        <p>There are a couple of things to keep in mind regarding accessibility when using systems like this.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>These systems let you define the template for all pages and which areas you will allow individual page editors to edit.</li>
            <li>Despite all of your work making a template accessible, user created content inserted into individual pages can still make a page inaccessible.</li>
            <li>These systems come with selectable themes, some of which are more accessible than others. Some themes will break some of the accessibility features of the base system. Some examples include
                <ul>
                    <li>non-standard main menu navigation systems</li>        
                    <li>keyboard focus becoming invisible</li>        
                    <li>semantic structures, like headings, being replaced by generic &lt;div&gt; elements</li>
                    <li>poor color contrast between foreground and background colors</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Individual content creators will need guides on how to add content accessibly to your site, like adding alternative text to images and headers to table rows and columns</li>
            <li>There are many community-created extensions that can be added to the systems that don't necessarily meet the accessibility standards of the base system</li>
            <li>There are also community-created extensions that can provide additional accessibility to end users</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Are there other CMSes that provide accessibility? Yes. These two systems are two of the most popular and most widely supported systems, plus they provide the highest levels of accessibility.</p>
        <h2>Development Frameworks</h2>
        <p>There are also many UI libraries that let you easily create interactive elements with a few lines of code. Some systems provide a lot more accessibility support than others. The ones with the greatest accessibility support are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Dojo</li>
            <li>YUI</li>
            <li>jQueryUI</li>
        </ul>
