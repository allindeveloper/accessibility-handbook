        <h1>What &quot;accessible&quot; means</h1>
        <p>To understand what &quot;accessible&quot; means itâ€™s helpful to first look at a broader term that encompasses much of accessibility - universal design.</p>
        <blockquote>Universal Design is the design of products and environments to be usable by all people, to the greatest extent possible, without the need for adaptation or specialized design. Ron Mace, Center for Universal Design, NC State University</blockquote>
        <p>Basically, universal design means that as many people as possible will be able to use our products without the user having to do any extra work or jump through any extra hoops.</p>
        <p>This history of accessibility for people with disability is full of hoop jumping and often falling flat on their faces. Special arrangements are constantly needing to be made in order for people with certain disabilities to interact with things many of us take for granted. One of the great promises of the Web is that through technology,  people with disabilities can often fully engage with an environment as effectively as people without disabilities. The advances in assistive technologies - technologies people with disabilities use to compensate for their impairment - have made this a reality, and often no special arrangement has to be made to allow them to do so.</p>
        <p>In order to make all of this work careful planning must be made when designing electronic content. While assistive technologies have made significant advances, they cannot perform magic. There are standards defined that tell developers how things need to be created in order to work with assistive technologies, and they tell the assistive technology vendors what to expect so they can build their devices to handle the content.</p>
        <p>The best part about these standards is these are not standards simply for people with disabilities. These are the same standards promoted by international organizations to help define a common language for Web technologies so that all of our browsers, Web pages, and Web applications can all work together.</p>
