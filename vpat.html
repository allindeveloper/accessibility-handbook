        <h1>Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (VPAT)</h1>
        <p>The Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (VPAT) is a document which evaluates how accessible a particular product is according to the Section 508 Standards. It is a self-disclosing document produced by the vendor which details each aspect of the Section 508 requirements and how the product supports each criteria.</p>
        <p>VPATs are used by buyers to determine how accessible a product is and where any potential deficiencies are.</p>
        <p>The <a href="http://www.itic.org/dotAsset/5644ecd2-5024-417f-bc23-a52650f47ef8.doc">official VPAT forms</a> are hosted by Information Technology Industrial Council and are available in the Microsoft Word format.</p>
        <p>The VPAT contains documentation on each of the following sections. The vendor only needs to fill out sections that are appropriate to the product.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Section 1194.21 Software Applications and Operating Systems</li>
            <li>Section 1194.22 Web-based Internet Information and Applications</li>
            <li>Section 1194.23 Telecommunications Products</li>
            <li>Section 1194.24 Video and Multi-media Products</li>
            <li>Section 1194.25 Self-Contained, Closed Products</li>
            <li>Section 1194.26 Desktop and Portable Computers</li>
            <li>Section 1194.31 Functional Performance Criteria</li>
            <li>Section 1194.41 Information, Documentation and Support</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>A Note to Vendors About VPATs</h2>
        <p>If your product does not fully support a given criteria, noting exactly how it does not meet the criteria is important. Stating that there is a problem and you are aware of it goes a long way toward building a good relationship with a potential buyer. Buyers can be willing to go with an less-than-fully accessible product as long as the company shows where their product's impairments are and shows a commitment to improving them.</p>
        <p>Buyers who receive VPATs that simply say "Supports" for each criteria will view you with suspicion, because most products do not fully meet Section 508 requirements. Additionally, if your product does fully meet a requirement, spell out how it meets that criteria in the remarks column.</p>
        <p>There are a <a href="http://accessibility.gtri.gatech.edu/assistant/products/pdf/vpat.php">list of suggested terms to use to describe the level of accessibility</a> support your product has.</p>
        <h2>A Note to Purchasers About VPATs</h2>
        <p>Even in some of the most truthful VPATs, interpreting the language and the amount of detail given is important. If a criteria lists something other than "Supports" but does not detail where the deficiencies are, you will need to do work to determine the extent of the deficiency. Alternatively, if you receive a VPAT that only says "Supports" for every single criteria with no additional detail, the form was probably not filled out with the necessary attention to detail.</p>
