        <h1>Accessibility and the Law</h1>
        <p>First, this document primarily covers accessibility regulations and United States Federal Law. Other countries have different laws, and individual states might have additional requirements beyond Federal law. Also, this document covers these laws at a very high level and only highlights portions of each law.</p>

        <p>The applicable laws regarding Web accessibility are as follows.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="http://www.ada.gov/">Americans with Disabilities Act</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://www.section508.gov/">Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://www.un.org/disabilities/convention/convention.shtml">UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities</a> (This is not covered in this document and does not impact the U.S because the U.S. has not ratified it, but it has been ratified by 129 other countries.)</li>
        </ul>
