        <h1>Accessibility and the Law</h1>
        <p>First, this document primarily covers accessibility regulations and United States Federal Law. Other countries have different laws, and individual states might have additional requirements beyond Federal law. Also, this document covers these laws at a very high level and only highlights portions of each law.</p>

        <p>The applicable laws regarding Web accessibility are as follows.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Americans with Disabilities Act</li>
            <li>Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act</li>
            <li>UN accessibility law (not covered in this document and does not impact the U.S, but it has been ratified by 230? countries)</li>
        </ul>
