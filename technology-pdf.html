        <h1>PDF</h1>
        <p>PDF files are popular because they give the author exact control over the look and feel of a document, regardless of the platform on which the end user is viewing the content. Also there are numerous PDF creation tools that integrate with almost any application.</p>
        <p>However, PDF documents are very difficult to make accessible. Only a few applications will make a PDF accessible with no additional work. Making a PDF file accessible usually involves using tools in Adobe Acrobat Professional to add accessibility information. The tools are cumbersome and clunky and usually require a significant amount of effort to use. Additionally, if you invest all of the work in making a PDF file accessible, if you later need to go back to your original source document to make changes and create a new PDF file, all of your previous accessibility retrofitting will be lost.</p>
        <p>Some applications that do offer some native accessibility support for creating PDFs without additional work in Adobe Acrobat are</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Microsoft Word, but only under limited circumstances</li>
            <li>Adobe InDesign, but careful planning from the very beginning must be made in order to ensure the PDF is accessible</li>
        </ul>
        <p>PDF files are viewable on a large range of products. They also bring up the issue of is it better to provide a file the user has to download or should it all be available online.</p>
        <p>When possible, PDF files should be avoided because of the lack of support in easily creating and maintaining accessible documents. If you need to use a PDF, be sure to plan thoroughly to ensure that your document can be made as accessible as possible.</p>
