        <h1>Introduction to ARIA</h1>
        <p>The Accessibility Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) suite is a collection of techniques to add additional accessibility functionality to Web pages, beyond what standard HTML elements can do. There is no one single way ARIA works with Web pages. Some ARIA techniques are extremely easy to apply, and some still require a lot of work on the developerâ€™s part in order to user correctly. It is easiest to understand ARIA  techniques when you look at the three ways they are used functionally within Web pages.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>ARIA Landmarks - identifies the function of each part of the page (i.e. the main content, the navigation area, the footer)</li>
            <li>ARIA States and Properties - attributes added to standard HTML elements that convey additional meaning beyond what the native element is capable of communicating (i.e. this form field is required)</li>
            <li>ARIA Live Regions - identifies areas of the page as containing dynamic content and defines how assistive technologies should handle them</li>
        </ul>
