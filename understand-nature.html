        <h1>Overview: Understanding the nature of what is required to design accessibly</h1>
        <p>To design something so that it is accessible means something specific. Often times the phrase &quot;Is it accessible?&quot; gets confused with the phrase &quot;Can I access it?&quot; In one sense they are both asking the same question - can all users get to what they need? But often when the latter question gets asked, itâ€™s not asked in its fullest sense. The intention of the question is more along the lines of &quot;can I access the file?&quot; While that type of access is certainly important, making something &quot;accessible&quot; in its broader sense means can all users effectively engage with the content, regardless of their impairment.</p>
        <p>Additionally, there are laws and standards which define who has to be accessible, what has to be accessible, to whom does it have to be accessible, and how do you define accessible.</p>
