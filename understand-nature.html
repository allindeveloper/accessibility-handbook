        <h1>Overview: Understanding the nature of what is required to design accessibly</h1>
        <p>To design something so that it is accessible means something specific. It means can all people, regardless of any impairment, interact with your content. How does someone who cannot use a mouse interact with your Web page? What if they cannot see? Does your site accommodate older populations and the issues they face?</p>
        <p>To help answer those questions there are laws and standards which define:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>whose sites have to be accessible</li>
            <li>what type of content has to be accessible and who needs to be able to access it</li>
            <li>how you determine what is and what is not accessible</li>
        </ul>
    </body>
