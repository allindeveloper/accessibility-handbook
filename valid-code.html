        <h1>Valid Code</h1>
        <p>It is important to have valid code on your Web pages. Web browsers are very forgiving with bad code, but that does not guarantee that your what you meant will actually be represented accurately by the browser and to assistive technologies.</p>
        <p>To fix this problem, simply run your code through a code validator, like the <a href="http://validator.w3.org/">W3C Code Validator</a>.</p>
        <div class="tip">
        <p>Note: ARIA attributes will be marked as errors in some Web pages like pre-HTML5 pages. ARIA attributes are fine to use in pre-HTML5 documents. If these errors are the only ones you receive from the validator, your page is fine. ARIA attributes should not be left out simply because they do not validate - they offer a huge benefit for accessibility and browsers know how to handle the attributes.</p>
