        <h1>Menus</h1>
        <p>Making a site's menu accessible has two basic principles.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Make sure the menus, including submenus, can be accessed using only the keyboard.</li>
            <li>Make sure the visual focus can always be seen when navigating the menu with a keyboard.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The above is true if you have simple menus and submenus that only contain links. Some menus, often referred to as &quot;Mega Menus&quot; contain many other types of objects like images, headings, and paragraphs. These can be very difficult to make fully accessible. You could make the case that these types of menus have moved beyond simple menus and are more in the realm of tabs and tabpanels.</p>
        <p>ARIA techniques can help to make menus with submenus more accessible.</p>
